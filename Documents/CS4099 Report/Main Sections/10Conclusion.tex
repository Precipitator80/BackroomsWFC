% Summarise what you achieved, what you found difficult, and what you would like to do given more time.
% Summarise what you achieved
The final project includes a simple game and designer tool for creating infinite worlds using Wave Function Collapse.

% What you found difficult
Implementing Wave Function Collapse and extending it with Infinite Modifying in Blocks presented a huge technical challenge. Ultimately, this detracted from work on the game itself.

% What you would like to do given more time
Key areas of further development are identified in Figure \ref{fig:futureGoals}.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Solver optimisation: Add multi-threading and lazy loading across frames to avoid lag spikes. Also, rework code to more efficiently carry generation data across layers.
            \item Ease of use for designers: Make it simpler to specify a tile set for generation in the Unity Editor.
            \item Added variety to game: Add more models to the existing level and add additional levels.
        \end{itemize}
